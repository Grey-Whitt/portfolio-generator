## Examples

---

Here is an example of one of the functions that uses the inquirer package to prompt the user for input.
```
const promptUser = () => {
    return inquirer.prompt([
      {
        type: 'input',
        name: 'name',
        message: 'What is your name? (Required)',
        validate: nameInput => {
            if (nameInput) {
              return true;
            } else {
              console.log('Please enter your name!');
              return false;
            }
        }    
      },
 ```
 
 Here is an example of promise chain that handles the flow of questions, then calls the writeFile() function to generate the portfolio based on the users input.
 ```
 promptUser()
  .then(promptProject)
  .then(portfolioData => {
    return generatePage(portfolioData);
  })
  .then(pageHTML => {
    return writeFile(pageHTML);
  })
  .then(writeFileResponse => {
    console.log(writeFileResponse);
    return copyFile();
  })
  .then(copyFileResponse => {
    console.log(copyFileResponse);
  })
  .catch(err => {
    console.log(err);
  });
  ```

There is an example output that was generated by the program provided in the dist file.
